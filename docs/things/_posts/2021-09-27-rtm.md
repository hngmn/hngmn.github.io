Readme is
[here](https://github.com/hngmn/hngmn.github.io/blob/stepsequencer/src/stepsequencer/util/language/rtm/README.md).

I have an rtm interpreter working on my drum sequencer ([here]({% link things/stepsequencer/index.html %})). Each
track's control panel has a text input where you can write in rtm to fill in the
track.
