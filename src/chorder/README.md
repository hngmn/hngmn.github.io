Chorder. A chord-playing tool.

## About
More info on the motivation on my [blog post](https://hngmn.github.io/things/2021/12/26/chorder.html).


## Todo
Tracking TODO here for now:
 * Add more notes 7ths, 9ths, 11ths
 * non diatonic scale
 * move away from explicit voicing controls, more easily control more
   interesting voicing parameters
    * Automatic "voice leading"?
    * Inversions (Or would that be included with above?)
    * More voices?

Long TODO:
 * Chord recording mechanism
 * non-real time chord building (add/change chord parameters, then button to
   'commit')
