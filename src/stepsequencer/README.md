### About
This is a React-Redux app for a step sequencer. I started it by following the MDN Web Audio API tutorial, modifying to fit
React-Redux design principles and my vision for the instrument-building capabilities and constructs.

### Tech
CSS from scratch
Typescript
React-Redux (with React Hooks API)
Tonejs (wrapper for Web Audio APIs)
Jest and React-Testing-Library

# Todo
* Local persistence
  * [x] save instruments
  * [ ] handle instrument ids, names, screennames
  * [ ] save sequencer state
